Hello üëã!

My name is **Alessandro** and I am a **Computer Science** graduate, and enjoy working at the intersection of CS and other disciplines. I carry a broad set of CS interests which gives me the flexibility to work on many different projects. These include:
- **Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI**
- **Cryptography, Security, and Blockchain**
- **Quantum Computing**
- **Algorithms** (with a enjoyment for competitive programming).
