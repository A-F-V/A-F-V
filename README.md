# **Alessandro Farace** 
Hello 👋!

My name is **Alessandro Farace** and I am a 3rd year student at the **University of Cambridge** studying **Computer Science**, and enjoy working at the intersection of CS and other disciplines. I carry a broad set of CS interests which gives me the flexibility to work on many different projects. These include:
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and AI
- Cryptography, Security, and Blockchain
- Quantum Computing
- Algorithms (with a liking for competitive programming).
